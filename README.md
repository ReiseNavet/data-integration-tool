# data-integration-tool
The Data Integration Tool was developed by students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The [ReiseNavet project](https://reisenavet.no/) provided guidance to the students during the development of the tool. 

The Data Integration Tool consists of a [front-end](https://github.com/ReiseNavet/data-integration-tool-frontend) and a [back-end](https://github.com/ReiseNavet/data-integration-tool-backend). A [report](https://github.com/ReiseNavet/data-integration-tool-report) developed by the students describes the development process along with how it was planned, the research conducted and methods applied.
